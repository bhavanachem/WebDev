# Filler Word Reduction Website

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered web application designed to help users reduce their use of filler words like "like" or "um" in conversations. The website provides an interactive AI bot that facilitates conversations, transcribes the user's voice, tracks filler word usage, and provides feedback. Registered users can also track their progress over time.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Conversation Tracking**: Users can engage in conversations with an AI bot that identifies and highlights filler words.
- **Real-Time Transcription**: Converts spoken words into text for analysis.
- **Filler Word Detection**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect and count filler words.
- **Progress Tracking**: Allows registered users to monitor their improvement over time.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Provides personalized feedback on speech patterns.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Languages
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactive functionalities and API integration.
- **Python**: Used in backend processing for speech-to-text and NLP analysis.

### APIs Used
- **Web Speech API**: Enables real-time speech recognition and transcription.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) / spaCy**: Used for processing and detecting filler words.

## Usage
1. Click the "Start Conversation" button.
2. Speak naturally while the AI tracks and highlights filler words.
